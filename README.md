Epicodus: Week6, Day2

2nd day with Active Record

********************

Lesson:

Make a point of sale (POS) system for a convenience store. A POS is a system that lets cashiers ring up customers for their purchases.

*  As a store manager, I want to add a new product to the POS, with its name and price, so that I can keep track of what we're selling.
  
*  As a store manager, I want to create logins for my cashiers, so I know who is responsible for ringing up which purchases.

*  As a cashier, I want to choose which products and how many of each a customer is purchasing, so that I can see what their total cost is.



*  As a customer, I want to see a receipt on the screen, so that I can make sure that the cashier rang me up correctly and told me the right total. I would like the cashier to be able to print out the receipt, but that ain't gonna happen ;)
